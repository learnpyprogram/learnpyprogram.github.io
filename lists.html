										<h1>Lists</h1>

									<h2>Introduction</h2>
									<p>Lists are a <b>collection</b> of datatypes that have an <b>order</b>. 
										The order is given by what is known as an index, where the count starts from 0 (First element is at index 0).
									</p>
									<p>Here are how to initialize a list, using square brackets []</p>

<pre><code># An Empty List 
a = []
#a[0] would crash because there are no elements
</code></pre>

<pre><code># A Singleton List
a = ["hello"]
b = [5]
c = [True]
#a, b, and c are all singleton lists
a[0] == "hello"
b[0] == 5
c[0] == True
</code></pre>

<pre><code># Multiple Element List
#Note that you can include different datatypes in the same list
a = ["hello", 5, True] 

a[0] == "hello"
a[1] == 5
a[2] == True
</code></pre>

<pre><code># Creating lists of variable length

a = [None] * 4
# a would be [None, None, None, None]

b = list(range(8)) #note range itself is not a list
# b would be [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

c = list("hello")
# c would be ["h", "e", "l", "l","o"]
</code></pre>

					<p>List comprehension is a powerful tool in creating lists of variable length.
						You will do this with a for loop inside []
					</p>
<pre><code>a = ["hi" for i in range(3)]
# a would be ["hi", "hi", "hi"]

b = [[None] * 3 for i in range(3)]

# b would be [[None, None, None],
		[None, None, None],
		[None, None, None]]

# b is what is known as a 2D list

# note how this can be related to a chess board (hint hint...)
</code></pre>

									<h2>Indexing and Slicing</h2>
									<p>Indexing and Slicing in lists is similar to strings.
										Indexing is when you access one element of the list. Slicing is when you access a range of elements between a start and end index.</p>

<pre><code>a = ["Hello", True, 5]
a[0] == "Hello"
a[1] == True
a[2] == 5

#Note the first index is inclusive and the last index is exclusive
a[0:1] == ["Hello"]
a[1:3] == [True, 5]
</code></pre>
									<p>One special property of lists is that it is mutable. Note that in the String chapter we said that strings are immutable, meaning that you can index and
										read from the string but you cannot change the character at the index directly. In Lists you are able to change the element at the index directly.
									</p>
<pre><code>a = ["Hello", True, 5]

#This writes a new element at index 0 (Note how this is similar to assigning a variable)
a[0] = "Bye"
print(a) # a is now ["Bye", True, 5]

a[1] = False
print(a) # a is now ["Bye", False, 5]
</code></pre>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Operations</h2>
									<p>Here are some of the most common operations on a list, which are <b>len()</b>, <b>max()</b>, <b>min()</b> and <b>sum()</b></p>
									<h3>Basic Operation</h3>
<pre><code>a = ["hello", 5, True]
len(a) == 3

b = [2, 4, 5, -4]
max(b) == 5
min(b) == -4
sum(b) == 7
</code></pre>
									<h3>Finding Operation</h3>
									<p>These operation allow you to check for where an element is in a list or not. The two main operations are <b>in</b> and <b>not in</b></p>
<pre><code>a = ["hello", 5, True]

"hello" in a == True #note how the expression evaluates to a boolean
8 in a == False

"hello" not in a == False
8 not in a == True
</code></pre>
									<h3>Adding Operation</h3>
									<p>These operations allow you to add to a list, which also allows you to build variable length list</p>
									<p>But first, lets discuss the difference between <b>destructive</b> and <b>non-destructive</b> operations. <b>Destructive</b> operations on a list change
										the original list while <b>non-destructive</b> operations create a new copy of the list while doing the operation (this means the original list stays the same).
										For example, assigning a value like a[0] = "hello" is destructive because it changes a. We will see further examples below.
									</p>
									<p>This first operation is called <b>.append()</b>, which adds an element to the end of the list <b>destructively</b></p>
<pre><code>a = ["This", "is", "a"]
a.append("list") #Note how the appending element is a string and not a list
print(a) # a would be ["This", "is", "a", "list"]

a.append(["list"]) #if we append a list we would get a 2D list
print(a) # a would be ["This", "is", "a", "list", ["list"]]
</code></pre>
									<p>These two operations (<b>.extend()</b> and <b>+=</b>) are similar and both extends a list with another list <b>destructively</b>. Note that extending a singleton would have the same effect as append</p>
<pre><code>a = ["This", "is"]
a += ["a", "list"]
print(a) # a would be ["This", "is", "a", "list"]

a.extend(["a", "list"])
print(a) # a would be ["This", "is", "a", "list", "a", "list"]
</code></pre>
									<p>Note how the above two operations are <b>destructive</b> as they change the original list a. Now I will introduce a <b>non-destructive</b> version of extend/+=</p>
<pre><code>a = ["This", "is"]
b = a + ["a", "list"]
print(a) #note how a is unchanged, it is still ["This", "is"]
print(b) # b should print ["This", "is", "a", "list"]
</code></pre>
									<h3>Deleting Operations</h3>
									<p>Here are the <b>destructive</b> deletion operations <b>.remove()</b> and <b>.pop()</b>. The <b>.remove()</b> method takes in an element and removes the first occurance of the element in the list. The <b>.pop()</b> method takes in an index and delete the element at that index in the list.
									<b>.remove()</b> doesn't have a return value, but <b>.pop()</b> returns the value it popped</p>
<pre><code>calendar = ["event 1", "event 2", "event 3", "event 2"]
calendar.remove("event 2")
print(calendar) #calendar would print ["event 1", "event 3", "event 2"]
calendar.remove("event 2")
print(calendar) #calendar would print ["event 1", "event 3"]

calendar_2 = ["event 1", "event 2", "event 3"]
first = calendar_2.pop(0) 
print(calendar_2) #calendar 2 would print ["event 2", "event 3"]
print(first) # prints "event 1"

# note that when you don't give a value to .pop() it pops the last element in the list
third = calendar_2.pop()
print(calendar_2) #calendar 2 would print ["event 2"]
print(third) # prints "event 3"
</code></pre>
