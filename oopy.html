										<h1>Object Oriented Programming</h1>
									</header>
<p>In programming, an object is a data structure that has user-defined properties and methods associated with it. 
	Objects are very useful in programming because they allow us to store lots of information and run specific functions according to object-oriented programming--
	for instance, we can create a Dog object with properties like name and age and run functions like do_a_trick.
</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Methods and Properties</h2>
									<p>Methods are like functions for classes, while properties are variables for classes. Lets take a look at how these appear in a class:</p>
<form>
<textarea rows=12 id="code1">class Dog(object):
	#__init__ is a special method, you may see other special methods with underscores
	def __init__(self, color, age):

		# properties can be used throughout the class with the tag self
		self.color = color # self.color is an attribute
		self.age = age # self.age is also an attribute
		self.cuteness = 100 # this is also an attribute
	
	# This is a method, because it is in the class Dog
	def birthday(self):
		self.age += 1 # note we change the value of attribute self.age here</textarea>
<button onclick="runboi('code1', 'output1')" type="button">Run</button>
<pre id="output1"></pre>
</form>
<p>In the Dog object above the properties are <code>self.color</code>, <code>self.age</code>, and <code>self.cuteness</code>. 
Note the difference between properties and variables--properties are a type of variable that can only be referenced with respect to an object.
</p>
<p>So how do we use an object? It's actually fairly simple:</p>
<form>
<textarea rows=16 id="code2">class Dog(object):
	def __init__(self, color, age):
		self.color = color
		self.age = age 
		self.cuteness = 100 
	
	def birthday(self):
		self.age += 1

Spots = Dog("brown", 3)
print("Spots' color is " + Spots.color)
print("Spots' cuteness is " + str(Spots.cuteness))
print("Spots' age is " + str(Spots.age))
Spots.birthday()
print("After celebrating his birthday, Spots is now %d years old!" %Spots.age)	
print(type(Spots) == Dog)</textarea>
<button onclick="runboi('code2', 'output2')" type="button">Run</button>
<pre id="output2"></pre>
</form>
<p>When we create Spots above, Spots is a variable that belongs to the Dog class! 
	This means Spots is an <b>instance</b> of that class--we can actually see this in the last line of code, where <code>type(Spots)</code> returns Dog! 
	You'll see that you can access the properties of the Spots instance by typing its name, a period, and what attribute you want to access (for example, <code>Spots.age</code>).</p>
<p>Similarly, if we want to use a method (fuction) of an object, we type the instance's name (Spots), a period, the function name, brackets, and whatever <code>arguments</code> that method needs. 
Here, when we call <code>Spots.birthday()</code>, we run the birthday function, which increases Spots' age by 1. 
Since this directly updates the value of the age attribute, the next time we use Spots.age, it'll be 4!</p>
<p>Note that the argument <code>self</code> is <b>only</b> used inside the code for the Dog object, and not for any instances. 
What this means is when you create Spots, you don't need to enter anything in the brackets for <code>self</code>--as seen on line 10 in the code above, we only need to set Spots' age and color. 
Note also that we don't necessarily need all properties to come from arguments! <code>self.cuteness</code> is set to 100 and doesn't rely on any arguments.</p>

<hr class="major" />
<h2>Inheritance</h2>
<p>Now that we know how to create a Dog, our next step might be to create specific types of Dogs. 
	For example, we can create golden retrievers, border collies, and, God rest their demonic souls, chihuahuas. 
	Obviously, each of these breeds are all dogs--so instead of creating an entirely new object for each of them, we can actually make them <b>subclasses</b> of the Dog object. 
	In the following example, we'll be creating a racing_dog that inherits the Dog object's properties and adds a property for speed; it will also be able to race in addition to having birthdays. 
	Lastly, when a racing_dog has a birthday, the Racing Committee will give it a special birthday congratulation, so we want to <b>add</b> to the existing birthday function.
</p>
<pre><code>class Dog(object):
	def __init__(self, color, age):
		self.color = color
		self.age = age 
		self.cuteness = 100 
	
	def birthday(self):
		self.age += 1

class racing_dog(Dog):
	def __init__(self, color, age, speed):
		super().__init__(color, age) # we go to Dog's __init__ and do everything there with the given color and age
		self.speed = speed # this wasn't defined in Dog, so we have to write it out here
	
	def race(self):
		self.speed *= 2 # multiply its speed by 2
	
	def birthday(self):
		super().birthday() # we go to Dog's birthday function and do everything there
		print("Happy %dth birthday!" %self.age) #then we print out this birthday message

Buddy = racing_dog("yellow", 5, 3)
print("Buddy's initial speed is %d" %self.speed)
Buddy.race()
print("When racing, his speed is %d" %self.speed)
Buddy.birthday() # this will print out the birthday message</code></pre>
<p>Note: Unfortunately our online coderunner isn't advanced enought to handle inheritance, so you're going to have to copy and paste this code into VS Code and run it there. D:</p>
<p>We see that <code>super()</code> essentially references the superclass, Dog, and runs the corresponding function there!</p>
<p>Lastly, if we want to check the type/instance of a subclass, <code>type()</code> and <code>isinstance()</code> start to differ. Example:</p>
<form>
<textarea rows=12 id="code3">class Dog(object): pass #we're just not going to do anything in these classes
class racing_dog(Dog): pass
Spots = Dog()
Buddy = racing_dog()
print(type(Spots) == Dog) # True
print(type(Buddy) == Dog) # False
print(type(Spots) == racing_dog) # False
print(type(Buddy) == racing_dog) # True
print(isinstance(Spots, Dog)) # True
print(isinstance(Buddy, Dog)) # True (surprised?)
print(isinstance(Spots, racing_dog)) # False
print(isinstance(Buddy, racing_dog)) # True</textarea>
