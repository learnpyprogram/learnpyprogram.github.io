										<h1>Loops</h1>
                                    </header>

<p>Say we want to find the first 10 nonegative numbers. 
    We could create a function that just prints all those numbers, ie. 
    0, 1, 2, ..., 9, but that seems like a lot of work. 
    And imagine if we wanted to print the first 100 numbers!
    Fortunately, programming allows us to use loops to simplify processes like this.
</p>
<p>A for loop runs an action a specified number of times. 
    An example is shown below:
</p>
<pre><code>def first_x_numbers(x):
    # this function prints the first x nonnegative numbers
    for i in range(x):
        print(i)
first_x_numbers(10)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, say we want to print the nonnegative numbers between x and y.
    We need to specify y as another argument of the for loop.
</p>
<pre><code>def first_x_numbers(x, y):
    # this function prints the nonnegative numbers between x and y
    for i in range(x, y):
        print(i)
first_x_numbers(3, 10)
</code></pre>
<p>We see that now the first argument in the for loop, x, is where the loop begins; 
    the second argument, y, is where the loop ends, but not including the y number. 
    Note that this is equivalent to a range of [x, y), where y isn't included. 
    So, the numbers that are printed are actually 3 through 9.
</p>
<p>Now suppose we only want every other number, eg. 3, 5, etc. 
    We add yet another argument:
</p>
<pre><code>def first_x_numbers(x, y, z):
    # this function prints the nonnegative numbers between x and y 
    # and skipping every z numbers
    for i in range(x, y, z):
        print(i)
first_x_numbers(3, 10, 2)
</code></pre>
<p>Now we see that this function prints 5 numbers: 3, 5, 7, and 9. 
    The third argument that is passed into a for loop specifies how much we step by 
    when looping through the range [x, y).
</p>
<p>What if we want these numbers, but in descending order instead? 
    Let's think about this step by step:
</p>
<p>First, if we're going in descending order, then we start at number y. 
    However, remember that y was not included in the previous loop--the loop ended printing number y-1.
    So, we should actually start the loop at y-1.
</p> 
<p>Second, we should end the loop at number x. 
    Following the same logic, if we want to actually include x, we should include it as x-1.
</p>
<p>Lastly, how much do we step by? 
    Well, we want every zth number in descending order: hence, we should step by -z.
</p>
<pre><code>def reverse_x_numbers(x, y, z):
    # this function prints the nonnegative numbers between x and y 
    # and skipping every z numbers, in descending order
    for i in range(x-1, y-1, -z):
        print(i)
first_x_numbers(3, 10, 2)
</code></pre>
<p>Let's do one more example: </p>
<pre><code>def is_prime(n): # returns whether or not n is a prime number
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for factor in range(2, n):
        if (n % factor == 0): # if n is fully divisible by a factor...
            return False      # then n isn't a prime number
    return True
for i in range(10):
    if isPrime(i):
        print(i)
</code></pre>

<h2>Nested for loops</h2>
<p>We can actually put loops inside of other loops.
    This is expecially useful when we deal with variables that may have more than one dimension.
    For instance, think about x and y values on a graph.
</p>
<p>Let's try and create a 2D-shape with nested for loops: </p>
<pre><code>def rectangle(height, width, char):
    # draw a rectangle with the char symbol having specified height and width
    for row in range(height):
        for col in range(width):
            print(char, end="") # we specifiy end="" so as to not create new lines
                                # along each row
        print()                 # now that we're done printing an entire row, we can add a newline
 rectangle(3, 5, "0")
</code></pre>
<p>Here's a challenge: try and draw a right triangle in the same format, with 
    the hypotenuse going from the upper right corner down to the bottom left corner.
</p>
<pre><code>def triangle(height, char):
    for row in range(height):
        for col in range(row + 1): # add 1 because we want to start with 1 char
                                   # in the first row and height+1 chars in the last row
            print(char, end="")
        print()
triangle(3, "*")
</code></pre>
<p>Some of you might be confused by this. 
    Note that "row", like "i" and "col" that you've seen in other loops on this webpage, 
    are actually variables! That means you can use them in other parts of the function.
</p>

<h2>While loops</h2>
<p>For loops are great, but some problems that require loops might not 
    necessarily have "ranges" to loop through. For instance, if we want to find
    the nth prime number, we don't have a specific range to look through--
    we kind of just have to look at numbers one by one and determine if they're primes. 
    For this, we can use the isPrime(n) function we wrote before.
</p>
<pre><code>def is_prime(n): # returns whether or not n is a prime number
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for factor in range(2, n):
        if (n % factor == 0): # if n is fully divisible by a factor...
            return False      # then n isn't a prime number
    return True
def nth_prime(n):  # returns the nth prime number
    found = 0
    guess = 0
    while(found <= n): 
        if isPrime(guess):
            found += 1
        guess += 1
    return guess
print(nth_prime(3))
</code></pre>
<p>A while loop will keep running as long as what's between its brackets evaluates to True. 
    Hence, in the above function, the loop will keep checking whether or not numbers are primes, 
    and if they are, record the number of primes we've found, all the way until we've found the nth prime.
