										<h1>Loops</h1>
                                    </header>

<p>Say we want to find the first 10 nonegative numbers. 
    We could create a function that just prints all those numbers, ie. 
    0, 1, 2, ..., 9, but that seems like a lot of work. 
    And imagine if we wanted to print the first 100 numbers!
    Fortunately, programming allows us to use loops to simplify processes like this.
</p>
<p>A for loop runs an action a specified number of times. 
    An example is shown below:
</p>
<form>
<textarea rows=5 id="code1">def first_x_numbers(x):
    # this function prints the first x nonnegative numbers
    for i in range(x):
        print(i)
first_x_numbers(10)</textarea>
<button onclick="runboi('code1', 'output1')" type="button">Run</button>
<pre id="output1"></pre>
</form>
<p>Now, say we want to print the nonnegative numbers between x and y.
    We need to specify y as another argument of the for loop.
</p>
<form>
<textarea rows=5 id="code2">def first_x_numbers(x, y):
    # this function prints the nonnegative numbers between x and y
    for i in range(x, y):
        print(i)
first_x_numbers(3, 10)</textarea>
<button onclick="runboi('code2', 'output2')" type="button">Run</button>
<pre id="output2"></pre>
</form>
<p>We see that now the first argument in the for loop, x, is where the loop begins; 
    the second argument, y, is where the loop ends, but not including the y number. 
    Note that this is equivalent to a range of [x, y), where y isn't included. 
    So, the numbers that are printed are actually 3 through 9.
</p>
<p>Now suppose we only want every other number, i.e. 3, 5, etc. 
    We add yet another argument:
</p>
<form>
<textarea rows=6 id="code3">def first_x_numbers(x, y, z):
    # this function prints the nonnegative numbers between x and y 
    # and skipping every z numbers
    for i in range(x, y, z):
        print(i)
first_x_numbers(3, 10, 2)</textarea>
<button onclick="runboi('code3', 'output3')" type="button">Run</button>
<pre id="output3"></pre>
</form>
<p>Now we see that this function prints 5 numbers: 3, 5, 7, and 9. 
    The third argument that is passed into a for loop specifies how much we step by 
    when looping through the range [x, y).
</p>
<p>What if we want these numbers, but in descending order instead? 
    Let's think about this step by step:
</p>
<p>First, if we're going in descending order, then we start at number y. 
    However, remember that y was not included in the previous loop--the loop ended printing number y-1.
    So, we should actually start the loop at y-1.
</p> 
<p>Second, we should end the loop at number x. 
    Following the same logic, if we want to actually include x, we should include it as x-1.
</p>
<p>Lastly, how much do we step by? 
    Well, we want every zth number in descending order: hence, we should step by -z.
</p>
<form>
<textarea rows=6 id="code4">def reverse_x_numbers(x, y, z):
    # this function prints the nonnegative numbers between x and y 
    # and skipping every z numbers, in descending order
    for i in range(y-1, x-1, -z):
        print(i)
reverse_x_numbers(3, 10, 2)</textarea>
<button onclick="runboi('code4', 'output4')" type="button">Run</button>
<pre id="output4"></pre>
</form>
<p>Let's do one more example: determining whether or not a given number <code>n</code> is a prime number.
    To do so, we want to check every number between 2 and <code>n</code> to see if the number can fully divide <code>n</code>.</p>
<form>
<textarea rows=10 id="code5">def is_prime(n): # returns whether or not n is a prime number
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for factor in range(2, n):
        if (n % factor == 0): # if n is fully divisible by a factor...
            return False      # then n isn't a prime number
    return True
for i in range(10):
    if is_prime(i):
        print(i)</textarea>
<button onclick="runboi('code5', 'output5')" type="button">Run</button>
<pre id="output5"></pre>
</form>

<h2>Nested for loops</h2>
<p>We can actually put loops inside of other loops.
    This is expecially useful when we deal with variables that may have more than one dimension.
    For instance, think about x and y values on a graph.
</p>
<p>Let's try and create a 2D-shape with nested for loops: </p>
<form>
<textarea rows=9 id="code6">def rectangle(height, width, char):
    # draw a rectangle with the char symbol having specified height and width
    figure = ""
    for row in range(height):
        for col in range(width):
            figure = figure + char 
        figure = figure + "\n"     # now that we're done printing an entire row, we can add a newline
    return figure
print(rectangle(3, 5, "0"))</textarea>
<button onclick="runboi('code6', 'output6')" type="button">Run</button>
<pre id="output6"></pre>
</form>
<p>Here's a challenge: try and draw a right triangle in the same format, with 
    the hypotenuse going from the upper right corner down to the bottom left corner.
</p>
<form>
<textarea rows=9 id="code7">def triangle(height, char):
    figure = ""
    for row in range(height):
        for col in range(row + 1): # add 1 because we want to start with 1 char
                                   # in the first row and height+1 chars in the last row
            figure = figure + char
        figure = figure + "\n"
    return figure
print(triangle(3, "*"))</textarea>
<button onclick="runboi('code7', 'output7')" type="button">Run</button>
<pre id="output7"></pre>
</form>
<p>Some of you might be confused by this. 
    Note that <code>row</code>, like <code>i</code> that you've seen in other loops on this webpage, 
    are actually variables! That means you can use them in other parts of the function. 
    Hence, when <code>row</code> increases with each iteration, more columns of stars are printed out!
</p>

<h2>While loops</h2>
<p>For loops are great, but some problems that require loops might not 
    necessarily have "ranges" to loop through. For instance, if we want to find
    the nth prime number, we don't have a specific range to look through--
    we kind of just have to look at numbers one by one and determine if they're primes. 
    For this, we can use the isPrime(n) function we wrote before.
</p>
<form>
<textarea rows=17 id="code8">def is_prime(n): # returns whether or not n is a prime number
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for factor in range(2, n):
        if (n % factor == 0): # if n is fully divisible by a factor...
            return False      # then n isn't a prime number
    return True
def nth_prime(n):  # returns the nth prime number
    found = 0
    guess = 0
    while(found <= n):
        guess += 1 
        if is_prime(guess):
            found += 1
    return guess
for i in range(5):
    print(nth_prime(i))</textarea>
<button onclick="runboi('code8', 'output8')" type="button">Run</button>
<pre id="output8"></pre>
</form>
<p>A while loop will keep running as long as what's between its brackets evaluates to True. 
    Hence, in the above function, the loop will keep checking whether or not numbers are primes, 
    and if they are, record the number of primes we've found, all the way until we've found the nth prime.
